							<h4>President | namrata.s@berkeley.edu</h4>
							<p>Hey innovators! My name is Namrata and I am a 3rd year majoring in Econmics and Public Health, and minoring in Math and Science Education. I have lived in the Bay Area all my life and I call both Cupertino and Cal my home. I love to learn new dance styles, go on long-distance runs, hit the gym, and eat a variety of different foods. My favorite music artists include Migos, Ty Dolla $ign, and Ed Sheeran. I am super excited to see even more of y’all at the Innovation Summit next semester and at our various events throughout the year :) Go bears!!</p>

							<h4>Vice President | evancorriere@berkeley.edu</h4>
							<p>Hey! My name is Evan Corriere, a Computer Science and Math major. I quickly found an amazing community here in Innovate Berkeley and have really enjoyed having the ability to help innovators! As leader of the Internal Team, I work on connecting Berkeley Students to speakers, managing our Core Team, and planning for the next Innovation Summit. Outside of Innovate Berkeley, I skateboard through campus and go to the gym in order to justify my ice cream addiction. </p>
